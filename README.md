# Cert4-Athlete-WebApp

## Description

I completed this project as part of my IT certificate 4 (programming) at Tafe in 2023.

It is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The project requirements were:
- To write a script to store and maintain the information of five athletes in parallel arrays. 
- The script will allow users to store the name and height of each athlete.
- The script will allow users to input an athletes name and return their height.
